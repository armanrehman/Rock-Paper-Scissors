# Rock-Paper-Scissors
I created an interactive **Rock Paper Scissors** game using **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on **DOM manipulation** and dynamic **UI updates** as part of TOP.

This project helped me learn how to:
- Incorporate **JavaScript logic** into real webpage functionality.
- Use **DOM methods** to dynamically update the interface based on user interaction.
- Build a fully responsive and interactive **mini-game** in the browser.

How It Works
- Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer picks a random option.
- The game updates the **score** and **results** on the screen.
- After 5 rounds, the final winner is announced and buttons are disabled.
